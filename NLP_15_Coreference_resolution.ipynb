        "## 1.2 Understanding\n",
        "**Coreference resolution** is a fundamental problem in **NLP** that deals with determining when different linguistic expressions refer to the same entity within a text.\n",
        "* It involves recognizing and linking all expressions (such as pronouns, noun phrases, or proper names) that refer to the same real-world entity.\n",
        "* This task is essential for understanding the meaning of a text and is used in various NLP applications, such as information extraction, machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "1. **Mentions:** These are expressions in the text that potentially refer to an entity. Mentions can be:\n",
        " * Pronouns: Words like \"he,\" \"she,\" \"it,\" or \"they\" that stand in place of a noun.\n",
        " * Proper Names: Specific names like \"Alice,\" \"London,\" or \"NASA.\"\n",
        " * Noun Phrases: Groups of words that describe an entity, such as \"the tall man\" or \"the software engineer.\"\n",
        "2. **Coreferent Mentions:** When two or more mentions refer to the same real-world entity, they are considered coreferent. For instance, in the sentence, \"John said he would come,\" the mentions \"John\" and \"he\" refer to the same person.\n",
        "3. **Anaphora and Antecedent:** An anaphora is a mention that refers back to a previously mentioned entity, known as the **antecedent.** In the example, \"The dog barked. It was loud,\"\n",
        " * \"It\" is the anaphora, and\n",
        " * \"The dog\" is the antecedent.\n"
