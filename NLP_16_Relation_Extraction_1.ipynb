        "* **Relation Extraction (RE)** in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of identifying and categorizing semantic relationships between entities in a text.\n",
        "* It aims to extract meaningful connections, such as relationships between people, organizations, locations, or events.\n",
        "* These relationships are often represented in the form of triplets: (entity1, relation, entity2), where \"relation\" describes how the two entities are connected.\n",
