        "**Lemmatization** is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or root form, known as the **lemma**. Unlike **stemming**, which simply removes suffixes from words, lemmatization considers the context and morphological (*relating to the forms of words,*) analysis of words, making it more accurate and linguistically informed."

        "## 1.2 Key features of Lemmatization\n",
        "* **Context-Aware:** Lemmatization uses the context of a word to convert it into its base form. For example, \"better\" is lemmatized as \"good\" because it considers the relationship between words.\n",
        "* **Part-of-Speech Tagging:**It involves tagging words with their correct part of speech (POS) like noun, verb, adjective, etc., which helps in identifying the correct lemma (a heading indicating the subject or argument of a literary composition or annotation) of the word.\n",
        "* **Dictionary-Based Approach:** Lemmatization relies on a dictionary to determine the correct base form of a word, making it more reliable than simple suffix removal.\n",
        "* **Meaning Preservation:** Lemmatization ensures that the root form retains the meaning of the original word.\n",
        "* **Context Awareness:** It takes into account the part of speech (POS) of the word, making it more accurate than stemming.\n",
        "* **Reduced Complexity:** By reducing inflected forms of words to a common base, lemmatization simplifies text data, making it easier to analyze.\n"
