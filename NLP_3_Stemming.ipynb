        "## 1.2 How Stemming Works\n",
        "**Stemming** algorithms, such as the **Porter Stemmer,** work by stripping common suffixes from words. For example:\n",
        "* **\"running\"** becomes **\"run\"**\n",
        "* **\"jumps\"** becomes **\"jump\"**\n",
        "* **\"easily\"** becomes **\"easi\"**\n",

        "## 1.3 Applications of Stemming\n",
        "* **Search Engines:** Improves search results by matching different forms of a word.\n",
        "* **Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis:** Helps in clustering similar terms.\n",
        "* **Document Classification:** Reduces the dimensionality of feature space by grouping similar words.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, **stemming** may sometimes produce non-dictionary words, making it slightly inaccurate compared to other techniques like **lemmatization**, which reduces words to their dictionary form."
