        "**Dependency Parsing** is a technique in *Natural Language Processing* **(NLP)** used to analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence.\n",
        "* It involves identifying *how words in a sentence are related to each other through grammatical dependencies.*\n",
        "* The output is a **tree-like structure** where *each word is connected to another word, with the connections representing syntactic relationships.*\n"

        "## 1.2 Key Concepts of Dependency Parsing:\n",
        "### 1.2.1 Head and Dependent:\n",
        "* In a dependency tree, one word is the **\"head\"** *(governing word)*, and the other is the **\"dependent\"** *(governed word).*\n",
        "* For example, in the phrase\n",
        " * \"eats an apple,\"\n",
        " * \"eats\" is the **head,** and\n",
        " * \"apple\" is its **dependent.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2.2 Arcs:\n",
        "* The connections between the **head** and the **dependent** are called **arcs.**\n",
        "* Each **arc** can be labeled to indicate the type of grammatical relationship *(e.g., subject, object, modifier).*\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2.3 Root:\n",
        "* Every sentence has a **root**, which is the main *verb or predicate.*\n",
        "* Other words in the sentence are connected either directly or indirectly to this **root.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2.4 Dependency Labels:\n",
        "* These **labels** describe the type of relationship between the **head** and its **dependent**.\n",
        "* Examples include\n",
        " * \"nsubj\" for nominal subject,\n",
        " * \"obj\" for object,\n",
        " * \"det\" for determiner, and\n",
        " * \"amod\" for adjectival modifier.\n"
